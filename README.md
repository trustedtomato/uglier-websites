## Motivation
Some websites, like Facebook, Insagram and Twitter are extremely addictive, but sometimes it's necessary to use them.
I've found that they are a lot less addictive if they are ugly.
But it's common sense, look at that screenshot, why'd you want to use those things?

## Goals
- Make the given website less pleasant to look at.
- While not reducing usability.
